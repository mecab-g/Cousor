## Original Text / 英文

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the most challenging neurodegenerative disorders, with current treatments offering limited symptomatic relief. Recent research has highlighted the crucial role of microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, in AD pathogenesis. This study investigates a novel therapeutic approach targeting microglial activation pathways to modulate neuroinflammation and amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation.

The research team conducted a comprehensive analysis of microglial gene expression profiles in postmortem brain samples from AD patients and age-matched controls. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis, they identified distinct microglial subpopulations with varying degrees of activation and phagocytic activity. Notably, a specific subset of microglia expressing high levels of TREM2 and APOE showed enhanced Aβ clearance capacity.

Based on these findings, the researchers developed a small-molecule compound, MG-101, designed to selectively enhance the activity of the TREM2-APOE signaling pathway. In vitro experiments demonstrated that MG-101 treatment increased microglial phagocytosis of Aβ by 65% (p < 0.001) while reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production by 40% (p = 0.002). The compound also showed good blood-brain barrier penetration and sustained activity in brain tissue.

To evaluate the therapeutic potential of MG-101, the team conducted a preclinical study using transgenic mouse models of AD. Animals were treated with daily oral administration of MG-101 for 12 weeks, followed by comprehensive behavioral and pathological assessments. The treatment group showed significant improvements in spatial memory tasks (p = 0.001) and reduced anxiety-like behaviors (p = 0.003) compared to controls.

Histopathological analysis revealed that MG-101 treatment led to a 50% reduction in Aβ plaque burden (p < 0.001) and a 60% decrease in neurofibrillary tangle formation (p = 0.002). Immunohistochemical studies showed enhanced microglial clustering around Aβ plaques and increased expression of phagocytic markers. These changes were associated with a 45% reduction in synaptic loss (p = 0.001) and improved neuronal survival.

Detailed molecular analysis demonstrated that MG-101 treatment upregulated the expression of genes involved in Aβ clearance and downregulated pro-inflammatory pathways. The compound increased the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines by 35% (p = 0.002) while reducing oxidative stress markers by 40% (p = 0.001). These effects were maintained throughout the treatment period with no evidence of tolerance development.

Safety monitoring throughout the study showed that MG-101 was well-tolerated, with no significant adverse effects on liver function or hematological parameters. The compound showed good bioavailability and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, with sustained therapeutic levels in the brain for up to 24 hours after administration.

These findings demonstrate that targeted modulation of microglial activity represents a promising therapeutic approach for AD. The development of MG-101 provides a foundation for novel treatment strategies that address both the pathological hallmarks and neuroinflammatory aspects of the disease. This study highlights the potential of microglia-targeted therapies in achieving better disease modification while minimizing side effects.
