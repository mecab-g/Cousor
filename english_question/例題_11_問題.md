## Original Text / 英文

Autoimmune diseases represent a significant challenge in modern medicine, with current treatments often leading to broad immunosuppression and associated complications. Recent advances in understanding B cell biology have revealed the critical role of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune conditions. This study explores a novel precision medicine approach targeting specific components of the BCR signaling pathway to achieve selective immune modulation.

The research team performed a comprehensive analysis of BCR signaling patterns in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Using single-cell transcriptomics and phosphoproteomics, they identified distinct BCR signaling signatures associated with disease activity and treatment response. Notably, a specific phosphorylation pattern of the BCR-associated protein CD79B was found to correlate with disease severity across all three conditions.

Based on these findings, the researchers developed a small-molecule inhibitor, BCRi-202, targeting the tyrosine kinase SYK, a key component of BCR signaling. In vitro experiments demonstrated that BCRi-202 selectively inhibited pathogenic B cell activation while preserving normal immune responses. The compound showed a 75% reduction in autoantibody production (p < 0.001) and maintained 85% of protective antibody responses compared to controls.

To evaluate the therapeutic potential of BCRi-202, the team conducted a phase 2 clinical trial involving 120 patients with moderate-to-severe autoimmune diseases (40 each with SLE, RA, and MS). Patients were randomized to receive either BCRi-202 or placebo for 24 weeks, with comprehensive immune monitoring and clinical assessments performed at regular intervals.

The results demonstrated significant clinical improvements across all three disease groups. In the SLE cohort, BCRi-202 treatment led to a 60% reduction in disease activity score (p = 0.001) and a 70% decrease in anti-dsDNA antibody titers (p < 0.001). RA patients showed a 55% improvement in ACR50 response (p = 0.002), while MS patients exhibited a 45% reduction in annualized relapse rate (p = 0.003).

Detailed immune profiling revealed that BCRi-202 treatment resulted in selective depletion of autoreactive B cell clones while preserving protective memory B cells. The drug reduced the frequency of pathogenic B cell subsets by 80% (p < 0.001) while maintaining 90% of vaccine-responsive B cell populations. This selective effect was associated with a 3-fold increase in regulatory B cell numbers and enhanced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.

Safety monitoring throughout the trial showed that BCRi-202 was well-tolerated, with no significant increase in infection rates compared to placebo. The most common adverse events were mild and transient, including headache (15%) and fatigue (12%). Importantly, no cases of severe infections or malignancies were reported in the treatment group.

These findings demonstrate that targeted modulation of BCR signaling represents a promising precision medicine approach for autoimmune diseases. The development of BCRi-202 provides a foundation for personalized treatment strategies based on individual B cell signaling profiles. This study highlights the potential of pathway-specific immune modulation in achieving better disease control while minimizing treatment-related complications.
